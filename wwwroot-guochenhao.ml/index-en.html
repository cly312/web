  <p>Guo Chenhao likes Ji Yuanwen</p>
  <p style="color:red;"> However, I and other students feel that<strong>Guo Chenhao and Sun Junran are going in both </strong>directions for the following reasons::</p>
    <p>1. The two of them are unobvious lovers. <a href="qt.jpg" target="_blank">Check out the link</a>
    <br>2. The teacher asked who I want to be at the same table with, Sun Junran wrote Guo Chenhao, and Guo Chenhao wrote Sun Junran<br>
    3. They both look at each other when they smile<br>
    4. According to my observation, Guo Chenhao or Sun Junran spend the longest time with each other after class, and they can even communicate with each other when there are two rows in class, and they can also know what the other party is talking about. Isn’t this a tacit understanding? 
    <br>
    Note: The love in elementary school and junior high school cannot last (although neither is pure)<br>Please contact the webmaster if you have anything to add
